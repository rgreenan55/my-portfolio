# My Portfolio

Hello, welcome to my portfolio git page. This is where I'm going to be working on storing, recording and organizing all my resume related information. Anything from work experience, to personal investments, all the way to the various school projects I feel show off the best work I can do.

Hopefully I will be able to keep up and improve upon this webpage as I get better as developing. That way all my experience and expertise can be compiled and shown here instead of spread throughout the various repositories on github.
